        <h1><strong>iPod</strong> touch</h1>
        
        <p>Engineered for maximum funnes.</p>
        
        <p>There’s thin and light. Then there’s thin and light on a whole other level. iPod touch has a superthin aluminium body that feels barely there in your hand or pocket. It comes in colours so fun, it’s hard to choose just one. With Apple EarPods, iPod touch sounds as good as it looks. And the iPod touch loop makes it all even more un-put-downable.

        <p>You can never have too much fun.</p>

        <p>The iSight camera lets you take your best shots. Facebook integration gives you plenty to post about. (Or you can just ask Siri to post for you.) And, of course, there are endless games to play and endless music to listen to. All on the thinnest, lightest iPod touch ever.</p>
        
        <h2>Beautifully designed</h2>
        
        <strong>It’s OK to stare.</strong>

        <p>When you see iPod touch for the first time, you won’t believe your eyes. But when you hold it in your hand — that’s when you get how unbelievable it is. It weighs next to nothing, yet it’s no lightweight: it still does all the gaming, surfing, messaging and everything else you love, more powerfully than ever.</p>

        <h2>4-inch Retina display</h2>
        
        <strong>Big fun.</strong>

        <p>iPod touch has a 4-inch Retina display, so all your fun has a beautiful canvas. Your hairpin car-racing turns, your dance party playlist, your favourite celeb gossip site — everything is sharp, vivid and lifelike. And the display is a perfect widescreen fit for your HD movies and TV shows because you can watch them all without letterboxing.</p>

        <h2>iSight camera</h2>
        
        <strong>Smile. It’s the best camera ever on an iPod touch.</strong>

        <p>The 5-megapixel iSight camera on iPod touch takes such great shots, you can ditch your point-and-shoot camera for good.1 Advanced optics, tap to focus, an LED flash and face detection help you get the perfect shot. Capture whole landscapes with the panorama feature. Shoot 1080p HD video. Or use the front-facing FaceTime HD camera to make video calls. You can even edit, crop and enhance your photos right from iPod touch using the Photos app.</p>

        <p>With iOS 7, taking photos with iPod touch gets even better. There’s a new square format option. And there’s a set of built-in filters that let you create unique effects. Shoot with a selected filter, or add it later. You can even remove the filter effect after you’ve taken the shot. For more editing options, try iPhoto or iMovie, available in the App Store.</p>

        <h2>Panorama</h2>

        <p>Use the panorama feature to grab a sweeping shot of your favourite city skyline, your graduating class in the bleachers or your dachshund stretched out at naptime. Just tap the button, move the camera over the scene and iPod touch seamlessly creates the perfect wide shot.</p>

        <h2>Music and video</h2>
        
        <strong>Up your entertainment quotient.</strong>

        <p>Every iPod is all about music. But iPod touch is about music and then some. It lets you bring your music and video library with you for an instant fix.</p>
        
        <h2>Music and iTunes</h2>

        <p>The latest song you have on endless repeat. The indie track your friend recommended. That classic rock album your parents loved — and, it turns out, you love too. Your music library is yours alone, and your iPod touch is where it all plays. And with every kind of music on iTunes just a tap away, you can find the perfect song for whatever mood — or room or car — you’re in.</p>

        <strong>Video</strong>

        <p>Movies and TV shows never looked better on iPod touch. Videos play in true widescreen on the 4-inch Retina display. Colours positively pop thanks to 44-percent greater saturation. And if you’re in the mood for that movie your friends can’t stop raving about, head to the iTunes Store, where you can download it right to iPod touch.</p>

        <strong>iCloud</strong>

        <p>When you download your favourite music, apps, movies, TV shows and books from the iTunes Store to iPod touch, iCloud makes all that content accessible on all your other devices — iPhone, iPad, Mac or PC — so you never have to connect cables or manually sync to transfer your content.3 It’s easy like that.</p>

        <h2>Games and apps</h2>
        
        <strong>Get ready for the big game.</strong>

        <p>Fast dual-core performance and sharp graphics make iPod touch the hands-down, thumbs-up, most popular portable gaming device in the world. The App Store features more than 1 million apps — including over 260,000 games and entertainment apps — many of which are free.4 Boredom, you just got served.</p>

        <strong>Game Center</strong>
            
        <p>This is where gamers become friends. And friends become foes. Game Center is your social gaming hub, where you create a profile, invite other gamers on your next mission and claim top-of-the-leaderboards bragging rights. Start a challenge with a random player around the world or with your buddy down the block. Let the schooling begin.</p>

        <strong>More from the App Store</strong>
            
        <p>Say you want to learn how to speak your name in Russian. Or find out who sings that great song you’re hearing in the store. Or get that photo filter that makes your pics look super vintage-y. Chances are, if you can think of it, you can find it in the App Store. And even if you can’t think of it, you can probably find it in the App Store.</p>

        <h2>AirPlay</h2>
            
        <strong>From one widescreen to another.</strong>

        <p>With AirPlay, you can wirelessly stream whatever’s on your iPod touch to your HDTV via Apple TV.7 Say you have some friends over and want a little more real estate to show them something that’s on your iPod touch — a video of you punking a friend or an epic scene from your favourite movie. Tap the AirPlay icon from the app you’re in — such as Photos, Music, Videos or Safari — and everything on your small screen plays on your big screen. You can also stream music to any AirPlay-enabled speakers or AirPort Express-connected speakers, so your sounds sound even bigger.</p>

        <p>And AirPlay Mirroring lets you share exactly what’s happening on your iPod touch screen at any given moment with everyone in the room — on your HDTV via Apple TV. Show a new site you discovered. Stream games live as you’re playing, and give your alien butt-kicking skills the full display they deserve.</p>

        <h2>AppleCare+</h2>
        
        <strong>Protection for your iPod.</strong>

        <p>Every iPod comes with one year of hardware repair coverage through its limited warranty and up to 90 days of complimentary support. AppleCare+ for iPod extends your coverage to two years from the original purchase date of your iPod and adds up to two incidents of accidental damage coverage, each subject to a $29 service fee plus applicable tax.</p>
